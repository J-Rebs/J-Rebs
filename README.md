Hello, my name is Joe, and I am currently a student in the Computer Science (CS) Masters (MS) Bridge Program at Columbia University (https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/). 
My own experience with CS started about a decade ago when I took my first introductory CS course in high school. 
Along the way, I've studied things like Economics and Spanish, been a teaching assistant, and worked at an accounting firm. 

In my freetime, you can probably find me in the nearest coffee shop or exploring the neighborhoods of NYC. 

If you would like to connect, you can find me on LinkedIn here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-rebagliati-4ab7a488/.
