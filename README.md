Hey there,

I'm a current MS in CS at Columbia University with a focus on software systems. I also have a degree in International Economics from the University of Notre Dame. After Notre Dame, I spent an academic year in Madrid, Spain as an English Teaching Assistant through the Fulbright Commission of Spain. I then returned to the US working in International Tax at Ernst & Young (EY). While at EY, I got involved with a variety of automation and computer science / data science related projects. I decided to return to school to further my interests in those areas.

In my current research and academic pursuits, my goal is to become as knowledgeable as possible in all parts of data management, analysis, and visualization from the perspective of software systems. My hope is to work on helping develop efficient data pipelines and associated visualizations that allow easy, fast extraction of data for analysis.

If that sounds like a fit for a need you have on your team, please reach out to me (see website link for details). My graduation date from my MS is December 2023.
