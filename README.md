Hello, my name is Joe, and I am currently a student in the Computer Science (CS) Masters (MS) Bridge Program at Columbia University (https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/). 

My own experience with CS started about a decade ago when I took my first introductory CS course in high school. 
Along the way, I've studied things like Economics and Spanish, been a teaching assistant, and worked at an accounting firm. 

Some programming languages I have experience with include Java, Python, and VBA. In Spring 2022, I will be learning C and SQL, XML, query processing, and some additional networking related skills. 

I also have experience in Mathetimatics including Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Introductory Mathematical Analysis (Metric Spaces, Sets, Sequences, Series, and some Functional Analysis).
