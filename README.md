I'm a current MS in CS at Columbia University with a focus on software systems. I also have a degree in International Economics from the University of Notre Dame. After Notre Dame, I spent an academic year in Madrid, Spain as a Fulbright Scholar teaching English, representing US culture, and coaching students for a Model United Nations conference. I then returned to the US working in International Tax at Ernst & Young (EY). While at EY, I got involved with a variety of automation and computer science / data science related projects. I decided to return to school to further my interests in those areas.

In my current research and academic pursuits, my goal is to become as knowledgeable as possible in all parts of data management, analysis, and visualization from the perspective of software systems. My hope is to work on helping develop efficient data pipelines and associated visualizations that allow easy, fast extraction of data for analysis.
